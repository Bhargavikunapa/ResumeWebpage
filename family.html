		<p> My family is a big part of my life. My sister is an electrical engineer working at Delphi, and my dad has his own business in India as welding machines supplier to industries. My mom is a home maker. They all work really hard to push me to be a better person, and for that I am grateful.

		<p> When friends are like family! We all have known each other since schooling and grew up together. They all live in India and I sometimes miss them. We may not speak with each other every single day but we always know we are there for each other! I can't wait to see them all in the December break!
