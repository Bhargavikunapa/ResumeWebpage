# ResumeWebpage
This is a webpage about me. I have primarily used HTML and CSS. 

# Features to look out for:
1. When you hover over images, I have added CSS elements to make them a little responsive.
2. In the Profile page, you can download my resume by clicking on "Download Resume".
3. You can click on "Bhargavi Kunapareddy" logo on the header to navigate to home page.
